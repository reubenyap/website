# About Reuben
===============

I am the Project Steward of Firo, a privacy cryptocurrency and lead the project in its overall strategy, development goals and research efforts. 
I am a strong advocate of online and financial privacy and my interviews and commentary have been featured in BBC, Nasdaq Tradetalks, Forbes, Coindesk, Reuters and Cheddar News, among others. 

Prior to joining Firo, I was a partner at a law firm with ten years of practicing experience having specialized in doing advisory work in legal and institutional frameworks.

I also co-founded BolehVPN in 2007 to combat internet censorship which was one of the world's top VPNs prior to me stepping away to focus on Firo and the cryptocurrency revolution.

In my spare time, I am the dojo-cho of an Aikikai Aikido Dojo and also am a licensed trainer of Crazy Monkey Defense, a modern martial arts system that has a boxing base combined with self preservation techniques.
